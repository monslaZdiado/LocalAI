*A Beautiful Mind* also explores the personal and professional life of John Nash, who was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. His father was an electrical engineer and his mother was a schoolteacher before she married[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. Nash showed an early interest in mathematics and science and was encouraged by his parents to pursue his education[^2^]. He graduated from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1948 with bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics[^1^] [^2^]. He then went to Princeton University, where he completed his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1950 at the age of 22[^1^] [^2^]. His doctoral dissertation, titled "Non-Cooperative Games", introduced the concept of Nash equilibrium, which is a fundamental theorem in game theory[^1^] [^2^].
 
Nash's academic career took him to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he became a professor of mathematics in 1951[^1^] [^2^]. He also worked as a consultant for the RAND Corporation, a think tank that conducted research for the U.S. military[^1^] [^2^]. During this time, he met and married Alicia Larde, a physics student at MIT, and they had a son, John Charles Martin Nash[^1^] [^2^]. However, Nash also suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, a mental disorder that caused him to have delusions and hallucinations[^1^] [^2^]. He was hospitalized several times and underwent various treatments, including electroconvulsive therapy[^1^] [^2^]. His condition affected his family life and his professional work, and he eventually left MIT in 1959[^1^] [^2^].
